FigRegistry-Kedro Data Visualization Pipeline Package

This package provides the data visualization pipeline that demonstrates the seamless
integration between Kedro's pipeline framework and FigRegistry's automated figure
styling system. The package serves as the primary example implementation showcasing
core figregistry-kedro capabilities including condition-based styling, zero-touch
figure management, and elimination of manual plt.savefig() calls throughout workflows.

Package Structure:
- pipeline.py: Complete pipeline definition with create_pipeline() implementation
- __init__.py: Package initialization and pipeline discovery interface

Key Features Demonstrated:
- F-005: Kedro FigureDataSet Integration with automated figure interception
- F-005-RQ-001: FigureDataSet intercepts matplotlib figures for automatic styling
- F-005-RQ-002: Kedro versioning integration for experiment tracking  
- F-005-RQ-004: Condition-based styling via pipeline parameter resolution
- F-002: Experimental condition mapping with dynamic style application
- F-004: Purpose-driven output (exploratory, presentation, publication)
- Section 0.1.1: Complete elimination of manual plt.savefig() calls

Pipeline Discovery:
This package exports pipeline creation functions following Kedro conventions for
automatic pipeline discovery and registration. The exported functions enable
Kedro's framework to properly load, configure, and execute the data visualization
pipeline within larger project workflows.

Usage in Kedro Projects:
The pipeline can be imported and used in pipeline_registry.py:

    from figregistry_kedro_basic_example.pipelines.data_visualization import create_pipeline
    
    pipeline_registry = {
        "data_visualization": create_pipeline(),
        "__default__": create_pipeline(),
    }

Integration Requirements:
- Kedro >=0.18.0,<0.20.0 for pipeline framework support
- figregistry-kedro for FigureDataSet and configuration bridge
- figregistry >=0.3.0 for core styling and output management
- Project configuration with figregistry.yaml or Kedro conf/base/figregistry.yml

This package demonstrates best practices for figregistry-kedro integration and
serves as a reference implementation for teams adopting automated figure management
within their Kedro data science workflows.
