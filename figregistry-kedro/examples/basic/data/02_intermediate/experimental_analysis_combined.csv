# FigRegistry-Kedro Integration: Comprehensive Experimental Analysis Dataset
# =============================================================================
# 
# File: experimental_analysis_combined.csv
# Purpose: Intermediate processed dataset combining measurements with experimental
#          metadata for complex multi-condition visualizations
# 
# Dataset Features:
# - Hierarchical condition parameters for complex styling (F-002)
# - Support for wildcard pattern matching and condition resolution
# - Derived metrics for advanced visualization context (effect_size, significance)
# - Multiple experimental parameters enabling complex condition scenarios
# - Educational demonstration of FigRegistry-Kedro automated styling capabilities
# 
# Integration Capabilities Demonstrated:
# - F-002: Condition-based styling with hierarchical resolution
# - F-005-RQ-004: Context injection for conditional styling via pipeline metadata
# - Section 4.2.2: Style resolution workflow with complex parameter combinations
# - Section 4.2.4: API synchronization with comprehensive experimental metadata
