# =============================================================================
# Publication-Ready Analysis Dataset for FigRegistry-Kedro Integration
# =============================================================================
# This dataset contains final experimental results with effect sizes, statistical
# significance measures, and publication categories formatted for high-quality
# scientific visualization. It enables demonstration of FigRegistry's publication
# output management through automated purpose-based styling and output formatting.
#
# Key Features Demonstrated:
# - Publication-ready data with effect_size, p_value, confidence_interval columns (F-004)
# - Purpose-based styling through publication categories (F-005, F-002)
# - Automated publication output management and versioning (F-004) 
# - Purpose parameter resolution in FigureDataSet (F-005-RQ-002)
# - Statistical significance indicators for realistic scientific context
# - Multiple publication figure types (main, supplementary, methods)
#
# Usage in Catalog Configuration:
# This dataset is designed to work with FigureDataSet entries configured with:
# - purpose: "publication" for publication-quality styling
# - condition_param: "publication_category" for automated figure type styling
# - High-resolution output formats (PDF, EPS) for journal submission
