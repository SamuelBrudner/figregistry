# FigRegistry-Kedro Integration: Publication-Ready Scientific Analysis Dataset
# =============================================================================
# 
# File: publication_figures_data.csv
# Purpose: Publication-ready analysis dataset containing final experimental 
#          results, effect sizes, and statistical significance measures formatted
#          for high-quality scientific visualization and journal submission
#
# Integration Capabilities Demonstrated:
# - F-004: Automated publication output management with versioned figure saving
# - F-005: FigureDataSet integration enabling purpose-based styling (pub purpose)
# - F-005-RQ-002: Purpose parameter resolution for publication-specific formatting
# - Section 4.2.3: Figure generation process with publication output workflow
#
# Publication Output Features:
# - High-contrast black styling for journal submission (publication purpose)
# - Statistical significance indicators for scientific rigor
# - Effect size calculations following Cohen's conventions
# - Confidence intervals for uncertainty quantification
# - Publication categories for figure organization (main_figure, supplementary, methods)
# - Automated formatting through catalog configuration per F-005-RQ-002
#
# Dataset Structure:
# This dataset represents the final stage of experimental analysis, aggregating
# results from intermediate processing into publication-ready format. Each row
# represents a scientific finding ready for visualization in peer-reviewed
# publications with automated styling through the 'pub' purpose setting.
