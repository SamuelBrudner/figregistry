# Condition Comparison Summary Dataset
# =============================================================================
# Final comparative analysis dataset containing cleaned experimental condition 
# comparisons, treatment effects, and group differences optimized for 
# demonstration of FigRegistry's core condition-based styling capabilities.
#
# This dataset provides the primary demonstration vehicle for showing how 
# identical pipeline code produces differently styled visualizations based 
# solely on experimental conditions without manual intervention.
#
# Key Features Demonstrated:
# - F-002: Experimental condition mapping for automatic styling
# - F-005: FigureDataSet integration with condition_param resolution
# - F-004: Automated output management with purpose-based formatting
# - Section 0.1.1: Elimination of manual plt.savefig() calls
# - Wildcard pattern matching and hierarchical condition resolution
# - Effect magnitude categories for automated styling variation
# =============================================================================

# Columns:
# - comparison_id: Unique identifier for each experimental comparison
# - treatment: Primary treatment condition for styling resolution
# - control_group: Control condition for comparison baseline
# - comparison_type: Type of statistical comparison performed
# - effect_magnitude: Effect size category (large, medium, small)
# - mean_difference: Numerical difference between treatment and control
# - confidence_interval_lower: Lower bound of 95% confidence interval
# - confidence_interval_upper: Upper bound of 95% confidence interval
# - p_value: Statistical significance (p-value)
# - sample_size_treatment: Number of subjects in treatment group
# - sample_size_control: Number of subjects in control group
# - experiment_phase: Phase of experiment (training, validation, testing, final)
# - analysis_stage: Purpose of analysis (exploratory, presentation, publication)
# - model_type: Algorithm used for analysis (linear_regression, random_forest, ensemble)
# - metric_name: Name of the measured metric
# - metric_value_treatment: Metric value for treatment group
# - metric_value_control: Metric value for control group
# - statistical_power: Power of the statistical test
# - effect_size_cohens_d: Cohen's d effect size measure
# - publication_ready: Boolean indicating if ready for publication
# - quality_score: Data quality assessment score (0-1)
