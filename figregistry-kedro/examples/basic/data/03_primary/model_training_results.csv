# FigRegistry-Kedro Integration: Final Model Training Results Dataset
# =============================================================================
# 
# File: model_training_results.csv
# Purpose: Final clean model training and validation results containing metrics,
#          performance indicators, and experimental conditions ready for 
#          publication-quality visualization through FigureDataSet automation
# 
# Dataset Features:
# - Multi-condition styling through model_type, training_phase, performance_category
# - Comprehensive model metadata for realistic ML visualization context  
# - Performance threshold categorization for automated styling demonstration
# - Support for complex condition resolution and hierarchical pattern matching
# - Publication-ready metrics with confidence intervals and statistical measures
# 
# Integration Capabilities Demonstrated:
# - F-002: Advanced condition-based styling with multi-parameter resolution
# - F-005-RQ-004: Complex condition resolution via FigureDataSet automation
# - Section 4.2.4: API synchronization with comprehensive experimental metadata
# - ConfigBridge: Hierarchical condition matching and fallback styling patterns
