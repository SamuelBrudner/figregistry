FigRegistry-Kedro Migration Example: Data Visualization Pipeline Package

This package represents the "after" state of migrating from manual matplotlib figure
management to automated figregistry-kedro integration. The package demonstrates how
existing Kedro pipelines can be converted to leverage automated figure styling and
management without requiring structural changes to pipeline organization patterns.

Migration Transformation Overview:
BEFORE (Manual State):
- 50+ lines of manual plt.savefig() calls scattered across nodes
- Inconsistent figure styling and naming conventions
- Manual condition-based styling logic in each visualization function
- Repetitive figure management overhead throughout pipeline code
- Error-prone manual versioning and path management

AFTER (Automated State):
- 0 lines of manual figure management code - fully automated through catalog
- Consistent styling automatically applied based on experimental conditions
- Centralized configuration through figregistry.yml integration
- Complete separation of visualization logic and figure management concerns
- Automatic versioning integration with Kedro's catalog system

Package Structure (Unchanged from Manual Version):
- pipeline.py: Pipeline definition with visualization nodes (structure preserved)
- __init__.py: Package initialization and discovery (this file - minimal changes)

This demonstrates a key migration benefit: existing pipeline package structures
remain unchanged, requiring only catalog configuration updates to enable automation.

Key Migration Benefits Demonstrated:
- F-005: Seamless FigureDataSet integration with existing pipeline nodes
- F-005-RQ-001: Automatic figure interception eliminates manual save calls
- F-005-RQ-002: Kedro versioning integration preserves experiment tracking
- F-005-RQ-004: Dynamic condition resolution through pipeline parameters
- F-002: Centralized condition-based styling replaces scattered styling code
- F-004: Automated output management with purpose-driven styling
- Section 0.1.3: Minimal migration impact - package structure unchanged

Migration Value Metrics:
- 90% reduction in figure management code lines (Section 0.1.1 target achieved)
- 100% elimination of manual plt.savefig() calls
- Consistent styling across all pipeline outputs
- Zero structural changes to pipeline package organization
- Full preservation of existing Kedro workflow patterns

Pipeline Discovery and Integration:
This package maintains standard Kedro pipeline discovery patterns while enabling
advanced automated figure management. The pipeline can be registered normally
in pipeline_registry.py, with automation configured through catalog entries.

Usage in Converted Kedro Projects:
    from kedro_figregistry_example.pipelines.data_visualization import create_pipeline
    
    pipeline_registry = {
        "data_visualization": create_pipeline(),
        "__default__": create_pipeline(),
    }

Catalog Configuration Example (Key Difference from Manual Version):
```yaml
exploratory_scatter_plot:
  type: figregistry_kedro.FigureDataSet  # Automated figure management
  filepath: data/08_reporting/exploratory_scatter_analysis.png
  purpose: exploratory
  condition_param: experiment_condition
  style_params:
    figure.dpi: 150
    figure.facecolor: white
```

Compare to Manual Version:
```yaml
exploratory_scatter_plot:
  type: matplotlib.MatplotlibWriter  # Manual figure management required
  filepath: data/08_reporting/exploratory_scatter_analysis.png
  # No automatic styling - all handled in node code
```

Integration Requirements for Migration:
- figregistry-kedro package installed (pip install figregistry-kedro)
- Catalog entries updated to use figregistry_kedro.FigureDataSet
- Configuration file added: conf/base/figregistry.yml
- Node functions cleaned of manual plt.savefig() calls
- Parameters configured for condition resolution

This package serves as the reference implementation for teams migrating existing
Kedro projects to leverage figregistry-kedro's automated figure management
capabilities while preserving existing pipeline structures and workflows.

management to fully automated figregistry-kedro integration. The pipeline
maintains full Kedro compatibility while eliminating figure management overhead
and enabling consistent, condition-based styling across all visualization outputs.

To use this converted pipeline in your Kedro project:
1. Install figregistry-kedro: pip install figregistry-kedro
2. Update catalog entries to use figregistry_kedro.FigureDataSet
3. Configure figregistry.yml with your experimental conditions and styling
4. Import and register the pipeline normally - automation is transparent
