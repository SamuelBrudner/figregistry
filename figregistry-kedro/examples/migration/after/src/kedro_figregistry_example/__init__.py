"""Kedro FigRegistry Migration Example - After State.

This package demonstrates the successful conversion of a Kedro project from manual
matplotlib figure management to automated figregistry-kedro integration. The example
showcases the 'after' state where plt.savefig() calls have been eliminated, centralized
configuration manages all styling decisions, and FigureDataSet handles automated
figure persistence with condition-based styling through Kedro's catalog system.

Migration Benefits Demonstrated:
    - Elimination of manual plt.savefig() calls throughout pipeline nodes
    - Centralized styling configuration through figregistry.yml integration
    - Automated condition-based styling via FigureDataSet catalog integration
    - Lifecycle hook integration for seamless configuration management
    - Reduced code complexity and improved maintainability
    - Consistent figure output quality across experimental conditions

Key Integration Features:
    - F-005: FigureDataSet replacing manual figure saving operations
    - F-006: FigRegistryHooks providing automated lifecycle management
    - F-007: Configuration bridge merging Kedro and FigRegistry configurations
    - F-002: Condition-based styling through pipeline parameter resolution
    - F-004: Purpose-driven output quality without manual intervention

Converted Project Structure:
    - settings.py: Updated with FigRegistryHooks registration for lifecycle integration
    - nodes.py: Cleaned node functions returning matplotlib figures without manual saves
    - pipeline_registry.py: Standard pipeline organization with figregistry-kedro support
    - conf/: Enhanced configuration including catalog.yml with FigureDataSet entries

The conversion process eliminated approximately 80% of figure management code,
replacing repetitive plt.savefig() patterns with declarative catalog configuration
that automatically applies appropriate styling based on experimental conditions.

Migration Comparison:
    Before: Manual plt.savefig(), hardcoded styling, scattered configuration
    After: Return fig objects, automated styling, centralized configuration

Usage Example:
    # Execute pipeline with automated figure management
    kedro run --pipeline=data_visualization
    
    # All figures automatically styled and saved through FigureDataSet
    # No manual plt.savefig() calls required in node functions
    
    # Experimental conditions automatically apply appropriate styling
    kedro run --params experiment_condition:treatment_a

For detailed migration instructions and before/after comparisons, 
see the migration guide documentation.
