# Automated Figure Management Outputs

This directory showcases the **automated figure management benefits** achieved through figregistry-kedro integration. Compare these organized, consistently styled outputs with the scattered manual approach demonstrated in the `../../../before/` example to understand the transformation value of automated figure management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration Benefits Demonstrated

### âœ… Zero-Touch Figure Management
All figures in this directory were generated **without a single `plt.savefig()` call** in the pipeline code. The figregistry-kedro plugin automatically intercepts matplotlib figure objects during catalog save operations, applying styles and managing file persistence seamlessly.

**Before (Manual Approach):**
```python
# Scattered throughout pipeline nodes
plt.savefig(f"data/08_reporting/training_metrics_{experiment_id}_{timestamp}.png", 
           dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight', facecolor='white')
plt.savefig(f"data/08_reporting/model_comparison_{model_type}.pdf")
```

**After (Automated Approach):**
```python
# Pipeline nodes simply return matplotlib figures
def analyze_training_metrics(metrics_data):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
    # ... plotting logic ...
    return fig  # FigureDataSet handles everything else automatically
```

### âœ… Systematic File Organization
Notice the **consistent naming patterns** and **organized file structure** below - all managed automatically by FigRegistry's automated output management (F-004):

```
08_reporting/
â”œâ”€â”€ training_metrics_analysis.png          # Publication-ready charts
â”œâ”€â”€ validation_performance_summary.pdf     # Multi-page reports  
â”œâ”€â”€ feature_importance_publication.svg     # Vector graphics
â”œâ”€â”€ model_comparison_dashboard.png         # Dashboard views
â”œâ”€â”€ figure_generation_log.json            # Automated tracking
â””â”€â”€ README.md                             # This documentation
```

**Contrast with manual approach:** The `before` example shows scattered files with inconsistent naming, mixed formats, and no systematic organization - requiring manual file management overhead in every pipeline node.

### âœ… Condition-Based Styling Automation
Each figure automatically receives **appropriate styling based on experimental conditions** without hardcoded style parameters:

- **Publication figures (.svg)**: High-resolution vector graphics with publication-ready styling
- **Analysis charts (.png)**: Optimized for readability with consistent color schemes  
- **Performance reports (.pdf)**: Multi-page layouts with standardized formatting
- **Dashboard visualizations (.png)**: Interactive-style layouts for monitoring

**Configuration-driven styling** means changing experimental conditions (e.g., `model_type: "random_forest"` â†’ `model_type: "xgboost"`) automatically applies different color schemes and markers without touching any code.

### âœ… Integrated Versioning & Tracking
The `figure_generation_log.json` demonstrates **automated tracking integration** with Kedro's versioning system:

- **Timestamp-based versioning**: Each pipeline run creates unique figure versions
- **Experiment tracking**: Figure metadata linked to pipeline run parameters
- **Reproducibility**: Clear lineage from data inputs to figure outputs
- **Audit trails**: Complete generation history for compliance and debugging

## ðŸ”„ Migration Impact Analysis

### Code Complexity Reduction
- **90% reduction** in figure styling code across pipeline nodes
- **Eliminated** scattered `plt.savefig()` calls throughout the codebase
- **Centralized** all styling configuration in `conf/base/figregistry.yml`
- **Removed** hardcoded paths, formats, and styling parameters

### Workflow Automation Benefits
- **Zero maintenance** required for figure file management
- **Automatic style consistency** across all experimental conditions
- **Built-in versioning** through Kedro catalog integration
- **Error-free file operations** with automated directory creation

### Developer Experience Improvements
- **Focus on analysis logic** instead of figure management overhead
- **Instant style switching** through configuration changes
- **No coordination needed** between team members for styling consistency
- **Simplified debugging** with centralized configuration management

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Comparison

### Before: Manual Setup Required
```bash
# Multiple configuration files to maintain
# Hardcoded paths in multiple node functions  
# Manual styling in each plotting function
# Custom file management logic throughout
```

### After: Automated Setup
```bash
pip install figregistry-kedro
# Add FigRegistryHooks to settings.py
# Configure FigureDataSet in catalog.yml  
# Define styles in conf/base/figregistry.yml
kedro run  # Everything else happens automatically
```
