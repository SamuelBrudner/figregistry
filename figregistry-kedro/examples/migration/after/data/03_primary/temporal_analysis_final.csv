# Temporal Analysis Dataset - FigRegistry Automated Time Series Styling
# =============================================================================
# This dataset demonstrates how FigRegistry's condition-based styling automation
# transforms temporal visualization workflows by eliminating manual time series
# styling decisions. Each row represents a temporal data point with metadata
# that enables sophisticated automatic styling through condition resolution.
#
# Key Benefits Demonstrated:
# 1. Automated temporal phase styling (baseline, intervention, followup)
# 2. Automatic trend direction visualization through condition mapping  
# 3. Dynamic quality-based styling without manual color/line management
# 4. Seamless integration with Kedro's temporal pipeline workflows
# 5. Zero manual matplotlib styling code required in temporal analysis nodes
#
# Integration Points:
# - analysis_phase column → maps to figregistry.yml condition styles
# - trend_direction column → enables automatic trend visualization styling
# - data_quality column → drives quality-appropriate temporal styling
# - time_period column → supports temporal organization and labeling
