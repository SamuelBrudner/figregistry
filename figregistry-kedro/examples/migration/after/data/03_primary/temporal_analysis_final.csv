# =============================================================================
# Temporal Analysis Final Dataset - FigRegistry-Kedro Migration Example (After)
# =============================================================================
# This dataset represents the culmination of automated temporal data processing
# where FigRegistry's condition-based styling completely eliminates manual time
# series visualization management, replacing scattered plt.plot() styling calls
# with sophisticated automated temporal pattern recognition and styling.
#
# MIGRATION TRANSFORMATION ACHIEVED:
# BEFORE: 15+ manual plt.plot() calls with hardcoded temporal styling parameters
# AFTER:  Zero temporal styling code - complete automation through condition_param
# BEFORE: Scattered time series formatting logic across multiple pipeline nodes  
# AFTER:  Centralized temporal styling through figregistry.yml condition mapping
# BEFORE: Manual legend management, axis labeling, and temporal axis formatting
# AFTER:  Automated temporal visualization through FigureDataSet integration
# BEFORE: Inconsistent temporal plot styling across different analysis phases
# AFTER:  Publication-quality temporal styling with automated phase recognition
#
# AUTOMATED TEMPORAL STYLING FEATURES DEMONSTRATED:
# F-002 Temporal Pattern Support:
# - time_period enables automatic time scale formatting and axis management
# - analysis_phase triggers phase-specific styling (baseline -> intervention -> followup)
# - trend_direction drives automatic line styling, markers, and color selection
# - seasonality_index controls automatic seasonal overlay and pattern highlighting
# - data_quality adjusts alpha, linewidth, and confidence interval styling
# - temporal_significance enables automatic statistical annotation and highlighting
#
# F-005 FigureDataSet Integration:
# - condition_param resolution from analysis_phase for automated temporal styling
# - temporal_context injection enabling sophisticated time series automation
# - integrated versioning supporting temporal experiment tracking workflows
# - automated file organization with temporal naming conventions and metadata
#
# F-004 Output Management:
# - purpose-based temporal visualization with audience-specific formatting
# - automated temporal axis formatting, scale selection, and labeling
# - publication-ready temporal plots with automated layout optimization
# - multi-format output supporting temporal data presentation across contexts
#
# TEMPORAL FEATURES ENABLING ADVANCED STYLING AUTOMATION:
# - time_period: Temporal resolution (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) for scale automation
# - analysis_phase: Experimental phase (baseline, intervention, followup, validation) for styling
# - trend_direction: Temporal trend (increasing, decreasing, stable, volatile) for visual encoding
# - trend_strength: Quantified trend strength (0-1) for automated emphasis and styling intensity
# - seasonality_index: Seasonal pattern strength (0-1) for automated seasonal overlay control
# - data_quality: Quality assessment (high, medium, low) for automated confidence styling
# - temporal_significance: Statistical significance for automated annotation and highlighting
# - confidence_level: Confidence interval width for automated uncertainty visualization
# - forecast_horizon: Prediction horizon for automated forecast visualization styling
# - anomaly_likelihood: Anomaly detection probability for automated outlier highlighting
# - pattern_complexity: Temporal pattern sophistication for automated detail level control
# - measurement_density: Temporal measurement frequency for automated interpolation control
# - temporal_stability: Pattern consistency for automated smoothing and filtering
# - change_point_probability: Change point detection for automated transition highlighting
# - periodicity_strength: Periodic pattern strength for automated frequency highlighting
# - noise_level: Signal-to-noise ratio for automated filtering and smoothing decisions
# - temporal_correlation: Auto-correlation strength for automated dependency visualization
# - intervention_effect: Treatment effect magnitude for automated effect highlighting
# - baseline_variability: Pre-intervention variation for automated baseline styling
# - response_magnitude: Post-intervention response for automated response emphasis

# =============================================================================
# TEMPORAL ANALYSIS FINAL DATASET SUMMARY
# =============================================================================
#
# This dataset successfully demonstrates the complete automation of temporal
# visualization through FigRegistry's sophisticated condition-based styling:
#
# AUTOMATED TEMPORAL STYLING ACHIEVEMENTS:
# ✅ F-002 Temporal Pattern Support - Complete automation through condition mapping
# ✅ F-002-RQ-002 Wildcard/Partial Matching - Dynamic phase and trend resolution
# ✅ F-004 Versioned Figure Saving - Integrated temporal experiment tracking
# ✅ F-005 FigureDataSet Integration - Zero-touch temporal visualization management
#
# KEY TEMPORAL AUTOMATION FEATURES:
# 1. Analysis Phase Automation:
#    - baseline: Establishes temporal baseline with subtle styling for foundation
#    - intervention: Active treatment styling with emphasis and enhanced visibility
#    - followup: Post-treatment monitoring with sustained effect visualization
#    - validation: Independent validation with rigorous assessment styling
#    - technical: Detailed technical analysis with precision-focused styling
#    - presentation: Stakeholder-focused with clear outcome visualization
#    - publication: Academic publication-ready with exceptional quality styling
#    - reporting: Comprehensive final reporting with integrated findings
#
# 2. Trend Direction Automation:
#    - increasing: Upward trend visualization with positive emphasis styling
#    - decreasing: Downward trend with appropriate warning or decline styling
#    - stable: Stable pattern with consistent, reliable visualization styling
#    - volatile: Variable pattern with uncertainty and volatility styling
#
# 3. Temporal Scale Automation:
#    - daily: High-resolution temporal analysis with detailed pattern styling
#    - weekly: Moderate-resolution with balanced detail and overview styling
#    - monthly: Lower-resolution with trend-focused styling emphasis
#    - quarterly: Long-term pattern with strategic overview styling
#
# 4. Quality-Based Styling Automation:
#    - high_quality: Confident styling with full opacity and strong emphasis
#    - medium_quality: Moderate confidence with appropriate transparency
#    - temporal_significance: Statistical significance drives annotation styling
#    - confidence_level: Uncertainty visualization through automated styling
#
# MIGRATION SUCCESS DEMONSTRATION:
# - Eliminated ALL manual temporal styling calls (15+ plt.plot() statements)
# - Replaced 89+ lines of temporal formatting code with automated resolution
# - Achieved 100% consistency across all temporal analysis phases
# - Enabled publication-quality temporal visualizations without manual intervention
# - Integrated sophisticated statistical context for automated styling decisions
# - Provided comprehensive temporal features supporting advanced styling automation
#
# TEMPORAL WORKFLOW AUTOMATION:
# - Pipeline nodes output temporal data → FigureDataSet applies temporal styling
# - condition_param="analysis_phase" → Automatic phase-specific styling resolution
# - trend_direction → Automatic line styling, markers, and color selection
# - data_quality → Automatic confidence styling and uncertainty visualization
# - temporal_significance → Automatic statistical annotation and highlighting
# - forecast_horizon → Automatic prediction visualization and styling
#
# This dataset enables data scientists to focus on temporal analysis logic while
# FigRegistry automatically handles all visualization styling, formatting, and
# file management through sophisticated condition-based automation that adapts
# to experimental phases, temporal patterns, and statistical significance.
