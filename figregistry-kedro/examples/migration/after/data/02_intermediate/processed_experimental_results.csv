# Processed Experimental Results - Migration Example (After)
# =============================================================================
# This processed dataset demonstrates automated styling through FigRegistry-Kedro
# integration by providing categorical variables that enable condition-based 
# styling automation. Each row represents aggregated experimental results with
# derived statistics suitable for automated visualization without manual styling.
#
# Key Automation Features Demonstrated:
# - treatment_group: Enables automatic color/marker differentiation per F-002
# - measurement_category: Drives chart type selection in automated pipelines
# - significance_level: Controls emphasis styling for statistical results
# - experiment_condition: Maps to figregistry.yml styling configurations
# - research_phase: Enables phase-specific styling (discovery/validation/regulatory)
#
# Eliminates Manual Styling Requirements:
# - BEFORE: Manual plt.scatter() with hardcoded colors per treatment group
# - AFTER: Automated styling through condition_param resolution
# - BEFORE: Repetitive styling logic scattered across 15+ pipeline nodes
# - AFTER: Zero styling code in pipeline nodes through FigureDataSet automation
# - BEFORE: Inconsistent chart formatting across experimental conditions
# - AFTER: Publication-quality consistency through centralized configuration
