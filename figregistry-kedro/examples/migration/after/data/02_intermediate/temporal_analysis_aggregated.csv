# Temporal Analysis Aggregated Data - FigRegistry-Kedro Migration Example (After)
# =============================================================================
# This dataset demonstrates automated temporal data processing where condition-based
# styling eliminates manual line plot styling, hardcoded color schemes, and 
# scattered plt.savefig() calls characteristic of traditional workflows.
#
# MIGRATION TRANSFORMATION DEMONSTRATED:
# BEFORE: Manual temporal styling with hardcoded parameters in every time series plot
# AFTER:  Automated temporal visualization through condition_param resolution
# BEFORE: Scattered plt.savefig() calls with manual path management for time series
# AFTER:  FigureDataSet catalog integration with automated styling and versioning
# BEFORE: Repetitive temporal plot formatting code across pipeline nodes
# AFTER:  Zero temporal styling code - handled automatically by FigRegistry
#
# AUTOMATED STYLING FEATURES ENABLED:
# - condition_param resolution from experimental_condition for line plot styling
# - trend_direction-based automatic color and marker selection per F-002
# - seasonal_component-driven linestyle automation through style engine
# - data_quality-based alpha and linewidth adjustment through condition mapping
# - time_window aggregation supporting automated temporal chart formatting
# - rolling statistics context enabling automatic axis scaling and grid settings
#
# COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS:
# - time_window: Temporal aggregation period (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
# - experimental_condition: Primary condition parameter for automated styling via F-005
# - trend_direction: Temporal trend indicator (increasing, decreasing, stable, volatile)
# - seasonal_component: Seasonal pattern strength (strong, moderate, weak, none)
# - data_quality: Quality assessment for automated styling decisions (high, medium, low)
# - measurement_count: Number of observations in aggregation window
# - mean_value: Central tendency measure for time series visualization
# - std_deviation: Variability measure for automated error band styling
# - rolling_mean_7d: 7-day rolling average for temporal smoothing
# - rolling_std_7d: 7-day rolling standard deviation for variability context
# - min_value: Minimum value in aggregation window for axis range automation
# - max_value: Maximum value in aggregation window for axis range automation
# - median_value: Median value for robust central tendency
# - percentile_25: First quartile for automated quartile visualization
# - percentile_75: Third quartile for automated quartile bands
# - autocorrelation_lag1: First-order autocorrelation for temporal dependency indication
# - temporal_pattern_strength: Overall pattern strength (0-1) for styling intensity
# - anomaly_score: Anomaly detection score for automated highlighting
# - confidence_interval_lower: Lower confidence bound for automated confidence bands
# - confidence_interval_upper: Upper confidence bound for automated confidence bands
