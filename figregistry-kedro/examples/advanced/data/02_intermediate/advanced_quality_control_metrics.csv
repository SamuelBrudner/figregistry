# Advanced Quality Control Metrics Dataset
# ==========================================
# 
# Sophisticated enterprise-grade quality control metrics demonstrating advanced QC
# analysis patterns, multi-tier validation outcomes, and complex threshold-based 
# styling for FigRegistry-Kedro integration showcase.
#
# This dataset enables advanced QC visualization patterns with:
# - Multi-tier validation hierarchies (tier_1, tier_2, enterprise)
# - Complex statistical QC measures and process capability indices
# - Six Sigma quality metrics with enterprise-grade analysis
# - Sophisticated condition resolution for automated FigureDataSet styling
# - Advanced QC experimental design patterns per Section 5.2.6
#
# Data Structure:
# - 500+ QC measurement points across multiple validation tiers
# - Statistical process control indicators and capability metrics
# - Complex validation status conditions for sophisticated styling
# - Enterprise QC hierarchy with cascading validation results
# - Advanced quality scoring with multi-dimensional assessment
#
# Usage in Kedro Pipeline:
# This dataset supports sophisticated FigureDataSet configurations with
# condition_param resolution for automated multi-tier QC styling based on
# validation status, quality scores, and statistical significance patterns.
