# Advanced ML Experiment Results Matrix for FigRegistry-Kedro Integration
# ============================================================================
#
# This comprehensive experimental dataset demonstrates the sophisticated 
# capabilities of the figregistry-kedro plugin integration for automated
# visualization styling, complex condition-based resolution, and multi-environment
# deployment patterns within enterprise data science workflows.
#
# Dataset Purpose:
# - Showcase hierarchical condition matching with F-002-RQ-002 wildcard support
# - Demonstrate environment-specific configuration overrides per F-007-RQ-001/002
# - Provide comprehensive statistical data for publication-quality visualizations
# - Enable FigureDataSet parameter injection and context resolution per F-005-RQ-004
# - Support Kedro versioning integration for experiment tracking per F-005-RQ-002
#
# Key Features Demonstrated:
# ✓ Complex experimental condition hierarchies (algorithm.hyperparameter.environment)
# ✓ Multi-algorithm comparison across baseline/candidate/champion model types
# ✓ Statistical significance testing with p-values and confidence intervals
# ✓ A/B testing framework with treatment groups and control conditions
# ✓ Environment-specific performance metrics (development, staging, production)
# ✓ Hyperparameter optimization results with convergence analysis
# ✓ Model interpretability metrics and feature importance rankings
# ✓ Performance monitoring with SLA compliance tracking
# ✓ Publication-ready statistical summaries with effect sizes
# ✓ Enterprise compliance metrics for governance and audit requirements
#
# Condition Resolution Examples:
# - experiment_id="baseline_logistic_regression_dev" → training.model.baseline.development
# - algorithm="random_forest" + model_type="champion" → training.model.champion + training.model.random_forest
# - environment="production" + performance_tier="high" → *.production + performance.target
# - statistical_significance="p001" → result.significant.p001
# - treatment_group="group_a" → experiment.treatment.group_a
#
# Statistical Data Completeness:
# - Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score, auc_roc
# - Statistical measures: mean, std_dev, confidence_interval_lower/upper
# - Significance testing: p_value, effect_size, statistical_power
# - Experimental design: sample_size, cross_validation_folds, random_seed
# - Quality metrics: data_quality_score, model_stability_index
#
# Environment Integration:
# - Development: Debug-enabled metrics with verbose diagnostics
# - Staging: Validation-focused metrics with quality gates
# - Production: Performance-optimized metrics with SLA monitoring
#
# Data Schema and Format:
# Comma-separated values with comprehensive metadata columns designed to
# trigger sophisticated condition-based styling through FigRegistry's
# hierarchical pattern matching and environment-specific override system.
