# Model Performance Comparison Summary - Advanced FigRegistry-Kedro Example
# =============================================================================
# 
# Publication-ready model performance comparison dataset demonstrating sophisticated
# condition-based styling capabilities across multiple experimental scenarios.
# This dataset contains comprehensive metrics for different model configurations
# (baseline, optimized, production) with experimental conditions that trigger
# FigRegistry's sophisticated styling system.
#
# Key Features Demonstrated:
# - Complex condition-based styling with multiple experimental scenarios (F-002)
# - Advanced FigureDataSet parameter resolution (F-005-RQ-004)
# - Multi-environment configuration capabilities (F-007)
# - Statistical significance styling patterns (F-002-RQ-002)
# - Publication-ready data format for enterprise reporting (Section 0.1.3)
# - Comprehensive experimental metadata for complex condition matching
# - Hierarchical condition resolution with wildcard pattern support
# - Performance-based conditional styling with threshold triggers
#
# Data Structure:
# Each row represents a complete experimental run with performance metrics,
# confidence intervals, and metadata that feeds directly into FigureDataSet
# for automated visualization generation with environment-specific styling
# based on publication context and experimental conditions.
#
# Condition Mapping Examples:
# - model_type: "baseline" -> resolves to "training.model.baseline" styling
# - environment: "production" -> triggers "*.production" wildcard patterns
# - experimental_group: "treatment_a" -> resolves to "experiment.treatment.group_a"
# - p_value: 0.0003 -> triggers "result.significant.p001" significance styling
# - confidence_level: "high" -> resolves to "inference.confidence.high"
#
# This dataset serves as both functional test data for the advanced example
# and a comprehensive reference for implementing publication-ready experimental
# visualization workflows using the figregistry-kedro integration.
