# Local Development Parameters Configuration - Advanced Example
# =============================================================================
#
# Development-optimized parameters configuration providing simplified experimental
# conditions, reduced computational complexity, and rapid iteration capabilities
# for local FigRegistry-Kedro integration development. This configuration maintains
# the sophisticated parameter structure of the advanced example while optimizing
# for development speed, debugging efficiency, and quick plugin validation.
#
# Key Development Optimizations:
# - Simplified experimental condition parameters for rapid testing (F-002)
# - Reduced model complexity for faster pipeline execution per Section 3.6.1
# - Development-specific parameter values for quick plugin validation (F-005-RQ-004)
# - Minimal representative scenarios for efficient condition_param resolution
# - Lightweight parameter sets enabling fast iteration workflows
# - Debug-friendly parameter hierarchies with clear naming conventions
# - Development parameter overrides supporting rapid prototyping scenarios
#
# This configuration enables efficient testing of:
# - FigureDataSet condition_param resolution mechanisms
# - Configuration bridge parameter merging (F-007-RQ-002)
# - Complex condition-based styling patterns in simplified scenarios
# - Multi-environment parameter management without production overhead
# - Advanced parameter-driven styling with rapid feedback cycles

# 2. A/B Testing Scenarios:
#    - condition_param: "quick_condition" -> Uses "quick_treatment_a" -> Light red styling
#    - condition_param: "control_condition" -> Uses "quick_control" -> Light blue styling
#
# 3. Pipeline Stage Testing:
#    - condition_param: "stage_condition" -> Uses "dev_training" -> Development pipeline styling
#
# 4. Model Performance Testing:
#    - model_type: "development" -> Uses basic development model with fast training
#    - performance_level: "basic" -> Uses relaxed performance expectations
#
# 5. Environment Testing:
#    - env_type: "local" -> Enables development debugging features
#    - debug_mode: true -> Enables verbose logging and detailed error messages
#
# 6. Output Testing:
#    - All figures saved to: data/08_reporting/figures/development/
#    - PNG format with 150 DPI for development speed
#    - Enhanced debugging metadata included
#
# 7. Configuration Bridge Testing:
#    - Local parameters override base parameters
#    - FigRegistry styles merge with Kedro configuration
#    - Enhanced logging for debugging configuration issues
#
# 8. Performance Optimization for Development:
#    - Reduced sample sizes (100-1000 vs production 10000+)
#    - Simplified models (LogisticRegression vs complex ensembles)
#    - Fast hyperparameter tuning (5-10 trials vs production 100+)
#    - Relaxed performance targets for development speed
