- Learning rate schedule impact analysis with sophisticated parameter resolution
- Training regime comparison (transfer learning, fine-tuning, from scratch) with business impact
- Performance tier analysis with dynamic styling based on model performance characteristics
- Enterprise training summary reporting with comprehensive visualization automation

Pipeline Discovery:
This package exports multiple pipeline creation functions following Kedro conventions for
automatic pipeline discovery and registration. The exported functions enable Kedro's
framework to properly load, configure, and execute sophisticated training pipelines
within enterprise ML workflows with complete figure automation.

Usage in Kedro Projects:
The training pipeline can be imported and used in pipeline_registry.py:

    from figregistry_kedro_advanced_example.pipelines.training import (
        create_pipeline, 
        create_training_validation_pipeline,
        create_combined_training_pipeline
    )
    
    pipeline_registry = {
        "training": create_pipeline(),
        "training_validation": create_training_validation_pipeline(),
        "training_combined": create_combined_training_pipeline(),
        "__default__": create_combined_training_pipeline(),
    }

Integration Requirements:
- Kedro >=0.18.0,<0.20.0 for advanced pipeline framework support
- figregistry-kedro for sophisticated FigureDataSet and configuration bridge capabilities
- figregistry >=0.3.0 for core styling and output management with enterprise features
- Project configuration with advanced figregistry.yaml or Kedro conf/base/figregistry.yml
- Advanced experimental design configuration for sophisticated condition resolution
- Enterprise reporting standards and styling requirements configuration

This package demonstrates best practices for advanced figregistry-kedro integration and
serves as the definitive reference implementation for teams adopting sophisticated
automated figure management within their enterprise Kedro ML training workflows.
