"""FigRegistry Kedro Advanced Example Project.

This package provides a comprehensive demonstration of enterprise-grade figregistry-kedro
integration within a sophisticated multi-pipeline Kedro machine learning project. The 
advanced example showcases complex experimental condition management, production-ready
deployment patterns, and sophisticated automation workflows that eliminate manual figure
management across training, inference, and reporting pipelines.

Enterprise Integration Features Demonstrated:
    - F-005: Advanced multi-pipeline FigureDataSet integration with complex condition resolution
    - F-006: Sophisticated lifecycle hooks with environment-specific configuration management
    - F-007: Enterprise configuration bridge supporting staging and production deployments
    - F-002: Complex experimental condition management for multi-variable analysis scenarios
    - F-004: Production-ready output quality management with automated versioning
    - F-008: Advanced plugin packaging demonstrating enterprise deployment patterns

Advanced Project Architecture:
    - Multi-Pipeline Structure: Training, inference, and reporting pipelines with dependencies
    - Enterprise Configuration: Environment-specific settings for dev/staging/production
    - Sophisticated Condition Management: Multi-variable experimental conditions and A/B testing
    - Advanced Utilities: Complex data transformation and statistical analysis support
    - Production Deployment: Scalable patterns for enterprise data science workflows

Pipeline Components:
    - training/: Machine learning model training with automated experiment visualization
    - inference/: Model inference workflows with real-time performance figure generation  
    - reporting/: Executive reporting pipeline with publication-quality figure automation
    - utils.py: Advanced utility functions for complex experimental scenarios
    - settings.py: Enterprise-grade hook registration and environment configuration

The advanced example eliminates manual figure management across complex data science
workflows, demonstrating how figregistry-kedro scales from simple visualization tasks
to sophisticated enterprise deployment scenarios with hundreds of automated figures
across multiple experimental conditions and pipeline stages.

Enterprise Deployment Example:
    # Execute complete multi-pipeline workflow with automated styling
    kedro run
    
    # Run individual pipelines with sophisticated condition management
    kedro run --pipeline=training --params experiment_group:treatment_a,model_type:xgboost
    kedro run --pipeline=inference --params evaluation_dataset:holdout_q4_2024
    kedro run --pipeline=reporting --env=production
    
    # Execute with complex experimental conditions for A/B testing
    kedro run --params experiment_condition:multi_arm_bandit,cohort:enterprise_clients
    
    # Multi-environment deployment scenarios
    kedro run --env=staging --pipeline=training
    kedro run --env=production --pipeline=reporting
