# Basic Pipeline Test Data for FigRegistry-Kedro Plugin
# This dataset provides simple, well-structured experimental data for testing
# fundamental plugin functionality including FigureDataSet operations, basic
# styling automation, and single-node pipeline validation per Section 6.6.4.5
#
# Data Structure:
# - experiment_id: Unique identifier for each experimental run
# - condition: Experimental condition mapping to figregistry styling rules
# - measurement: Primary dependent variable (continuous)
# - measurement_error: Standard error for error bar testing
# - category: Grouping variable for multi-series plots
# - time_point: Temporal dimension for time-series analysis
# - sample_size: Sample size for statistical validation
# - p_value: Statistical significance for publication-quality plots
# - effect_size: Effect magnitude for presentation scenarios
# - purpose: Analysis purpose mapping to FigRegistry path aliases
