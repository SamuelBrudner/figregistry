# FigRegistry Kedro Configuration Base - Merge Conflict Testing
#
# This configuration file serves as the baseline for testing configuration 
# merging conflicts and precedence resolution within the FigRegistryConfigBridge 
# component. It provides specific values designed to conflict with the companion 
# merge_conflict_override.yml file to validate that override configurations 
# correctly take precedence during the merging process.
#
# Purpose: Establish baseline configuration values that will be systematically 
# overridden by merge_conflict_override.yml to test the precedence rules:
# 1. Environment-specific Kedro configurations override base configurations
# 2. Kedro configurations override standalone figregistry.yaml settings  
# 3. Deep merging for nested dictionaries
# 4. Lists are replaced entirely (no merging)
#
# Testing Validation: This configuration is designed to support comprehensive
# testing of F-007 (Configuration Bridge) feature requirements per Section 5.2.5
