# FigRegistry Kedro Base Configuration - Merge Conflict Testing
#
# This configuration file establishes baseline settings specifically designed 
# for testing configuration merging conflicts and precedence resolution in the 
# FigRegistryConfigBridge. Every setting in this file has corresponding 
# conflicting values in merge_conflict_override.yml to systematically validate 
# the configuration bridge's precedence handling capabilities per F-007 requirements.
#
# Purpose: Provide foundation configuration values that will be systematically 
# overridden to test precedence rules defined in Section 5.2.5:
# 1. Environment-specific overrides take precedence over base configurations
# 2. Kedro configurations override standalone figregistry.yaml settings  
# 3. Deep merging behavior for nested dictionaries
# 4. Complete replacement behavior for lists
# 5. Type-safe validation across merged configurations
#
# Testing Framework: This base configuration enables comprehensive validation 
# of F-007 Configuration Bridge Requirements through systematic conflict resolution
