# FigRegistry Kedro Configuration Override - Merge Conflict Testing
#
# This configuration file is designed to conflict with merge_conflict_base.yml
# for comprehensive testing of configuration precedence resolution and conflict
# handling within the FigRegistryConfigBridge component.
#
# Purpose: Validate that override configurations correctly take precedence over
# base configurations during the merging process, testing the precedence rules:
# 1. Environment-specific Kedro configurations override base configurations
# 2. Kedro configurations override standalone figregistry.yaml settings
# 3. Deep merging for nested dictionaries
# 4. Lists are replaced entirely (no merging)
