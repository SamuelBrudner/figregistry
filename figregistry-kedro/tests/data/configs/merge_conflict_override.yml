# FigRegistry Kedro Configuration Override - Merge Conflict Testing
#
# This configuration file provides systematic conflicts with merge_conflict_base.yml
# to validate the FigRegistryConfigBridge's configuration precedence resolution 
# and merging behavior. It implements deliberate conflicts across all configuration 
# sections to ensure that override configurations correctly take precedence during 
# the merging process per F-007 requirements.
#
# Purpose: Establish override values that systematically conflict with base 
# configuration to test precedence rules defined in Section 5.2.5:
# 1. Environment-specific overrides take precedence over base configurations
# 2. Kedro configurations override standalone figregistry.yaml settings
# 3. Deep merging behavior for nested dictionaries
# 4. Complete replacement behavior for lists
# 5. Type-safe validation across merged configurations
#
# Testing Validation: This override configuration validates F-007 Configuration 
# Bridge Requirements through comprehensive conflict resolution testing
